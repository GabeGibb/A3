# Code Instructions

To run the code, please follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a developer folder containing all the HTML files for this project.

## Step 1: Indexing

1. Run the `indexer.py` file.
2. The program will create temporary indices in a folder.
3. It will then merge and distribute them to different offloaded indices.
4. Please note that this process may take a fair bit of time, possibly around an hour or more.
5. Once completed, a folder called `indices` will be generated. Please be aware that this folder can be quite large and opening it may crash your code editor.

## Step 2: Searching

1. After the indexing process is finished, run the `search.py` file.
2. This file uses the `indices` folder to search the HTML files.
3. The program will provide the top 5 URLs for a search query.
4. Follow the instructions in the command prompt to use the search functionality.

That's it! You should now be able to run the code and perform searches on the HTML files.
